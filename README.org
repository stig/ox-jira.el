* Introduction

  This module plugs into the regular Org Export Engine and transforms Org
  files to JIRA markup for pasting into JIRA tickets & comments.

  My last three jobs I've had to use JIRA, and had to deal with its (to me)
  incredibly unintuitive markup format. Having discovered---and fallen in
  love with---Org mode I now find myself writing everything in Org and
  exporting to various other formats (html, markdown, plain text) but I
  haven't been able to find a way to export to JIRA. So I am attempting to
  write one, and learn about Emacs package development at the same time.

* Usage

  In an Org buffer, hit =C-c C-e j j= to bring up =*Org Export Dispatcher*=
  and export it as a JIRA buffer. You can then use =C-x h= to mark the whole
  buffer, then =M-w= to save it to the kill ring (and global pasteboard) for
  pasting into JIRA issues.

  Alternatively, you can export to the kill ring automatically for
  interactive exports by setting this in your =.emacs.el= file:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq org-export-copy-to-kill-ring 'if-interactive)
  #+END_SRC

* Installation

  This library is on Melpa. You can install it like this:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  M-x package-install RET ox-jira RET
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Manual installation

  If you don't want to install from Melpa, simply clone this repo and do:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  M-x load-file RET ox-jira.el RET
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Maturity

  It does what I want, and it has tests for that. YMMV.

* Contributing

  I'm happy to consider contributions. Since this is my first attempt at an
  Emacs package I've bound to have made lots of mistakes. Help me correct
  them, and keep the pull requests coming!

  I am more likely to merge code contributions if they come with tests.
  However, code contributions are not everything. Opening an issue with a
  reproducible test case, like "I expected this but got this" is also a
  valuable contribution.

  Running the =./run-tests.sh= script should run all the tests automatically.
